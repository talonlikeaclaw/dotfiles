# Talon's Linux Dotfiles

This is where I keep track of my personal configuration files for the plethora of useful applications I use daily.

Originally, the repo was primarily tracking my MacBook configs on the `main` branch. However, I have since shifted to maintaining two branches for both macOS and Linux.

From this point forward:
- The `main` branch will track my Linux configs.
- The `endeavour` branch will track my most recent Arch (btw) configs.
- The `macbook` branch will track my MacOS configs.

Currently, this repo contains my configuration files for the following:

- **Bat**: A `cat` replacement
- **Fish**: A Unix-like shell designed for usability and interactivity
- **Ghostty**: A GPU-accelerated terminal emulator with simple configuration
- **FastFetch**: A beautiful ASCII art output with system information
- **Starship**: A highly customizable prompt customizer with a beautiful design
- **Tmux**: An amazing terminal multiplexer that maintains persistent sessions after rebooting
- **Zed**: An awesome open-source AI-integrated editor written in Rust, usable with local Ollama LLM models

I also previously maintained a Neovim config in this repo but have since moved it to [another repository](https://github.com/talonlikeaclaw/talonvim).

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to open an issue.
